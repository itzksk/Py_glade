- currently working in mar20.py.
- should do the job using multithreading.
- main_thread should block in gtk.main() and will wait listening to events.
- upon event, the event handler will be incoked, which will spawn a thread to finish the job.
- Do not forget the thread clean-up process.

Thank You
